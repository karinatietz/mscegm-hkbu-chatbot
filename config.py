Accommodation

Grenoble

As the Grenoble campus is located in downtown Grenoble, the School does not offer student housing. In addition to the primary housing services (CROUS, ARPEJ, Le CLEF, ONLE, etc.), the School has a private online platform dedicated to housing for Grenoble Ecole de Management students in Grenoble, across France and abroad.

The Annual School Awards of the HKBU School of Business recognise colleagues for their outstanding teaching, research and service. Five faculty members were honoured in the Awards for 2022-23.
Service Award

Dr. Clara KAN, Senior Lecturer, Department of Management, Marketing and Information Systems

Dr. Clara Kan is an accomplished marketing professional before her teaching career. The footprint of her career covered telecommunications, retail, financial services and FMCG advertising at various senior positions.  She has served as the Associate and then Programme Director of the MSc in Entrepreneurship and Global Marketing (MScEGM) programme, and the BBA Marketing concentration coordinator, since 2018 and 2019, respectively. On top of the usual work as a concentration coordinator, Dr. Kan has walked extra miles to connect with prospective Senior Year candidates in 2020 and 2021 and thus brought a surge in senior year applications. Dr. Kan has worked relentlessly on the smooth conversion of the MScEGM from a joint degree to a double degree programme with Grenoble Ecole de Management. Such transformation has brought a 300%+ increase of student applications, a streamlined programme administration and a higher flexibility for incoming students. With her expertise in social innovation and entrepreneurship, Dr. Kan has contributed to relevant GE courses by providing advice on the course development. In addition to programme and department levels, Dr. Kan has been actively involved in School committees as a member of the School’s Internationalization Advisory Group from 2018 to 2021 and of the Task Force on the Assessment and Enhancement of Graduate Employability. Beyond HKBU, Dr. Kan has been an appointed advisory committee member of the Enhancing Self-Reliance Through District Partnership Programme of Home Affairs Bureau since 2018. She has also been on the board of Fullness Social Enterprises Society Limited since its inception in 2012. Through the years, Dr. Kan has been a trainer for capacity building of numerous social enterprises and NGOs. She sits on the governance committee of multi-million projects funded by SIE Fund, and has co-authored three booklets related to social enterprises practice in Hong Kong.


Innovation in Action: School of Business Students Win Bronze at 2024 JingNiuHui Cup

A team of students from the HKBU School of Business has garnered remarkable recognition by winning the Bronze Award at the 2024 JingNiuHui Cup Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition (JingNiuHui Cup). Held at the Maker Centre of the Beijing Normal University-Hong Kong Baptist University United International College (UIC) in Zhuhai on 28 September 2024, the final competition featured strong contenders, including six UIC teams and two additional HKBU teams from different faculties.

The EZone Project team, composed of three MSc in Entrepreneurship and Global Marketing (MScEGM) students, PANG Boling, CAI Wenxin, and BAI Haowen, distinguished itself by proposing an innovative digital platform designed to leverage social connections to enhance global study paths. This concept not only earned them the Bronze Award but also followed their earlier achievement as Second Runner-up at the School’s Dean’s Cup Business Innovation Gymnasium (BIG) 9.0, a competition focused on helping students to develop and showcase their business ideas. This earlier success led to their nomination for the JingNiuHui Cup.

Dr. Marta DOWEIKO, Assistant Dean (Global Engagement) and Director of the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Centre (EIC), was invited to judge the competition and deliver a speech. She praised the innovative ideas presented and expressed enthusiasm for future collaborations between the UIC and HKBU to foster more achievements.

Additionally, two other HKBU teams from different faculties received accolades, including the Silver Award and the Consolation Prize, for their creative projects.

Since its inception in 2018, the JingNiuHui Cup has been a key event in promoting innovation and entrepreneurship in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. This year’s competition highlighted the innovative abilities and entrepreneurial spirit of students from both institutions, offering participants broader development opportunities and enhanced resource support.



MScEGM's 2025 Reunion Celebrates Community and AI's Marketing Revolution

The Master of Science in Entrepreneurship and Global Marketing Programme (MScEGM) Alumni Gathering Dinner 2025 brought together 80 guests in Sai Kung for an evening filled with laughter, memories, and meaningful connections in April. Aptly named “A Rendezvous to Remember”, the event celebrated the lasting connections within the MScEGM community.

Faculty, alumni, and students reunited, sharing stories and catching up on each other's lives. The room was alive with conversation, as everyone exchanged ideas and insights, making the evening both enjoyable and enriching.

A highlight of the evening was the engaging and dynamic talk by Mr. Corum CHU, Head of Group Marketing and Communications at AGBA Group, on AI's transformative impact on marketing. Mr. CHU masterfully demonstrated how AI is transforming marketing — from research and ideation to content creation and graphic design — supported by vivid, real-world examples. His presentation was a standout, blending playful wit with sharp insights, as he used comic-style cartoon graphics to reveal how AI supercharges marketing messaging. The climax? A live AI demonstration featuring Dr. Clara KAN, which not only captivated the audience but also proved AI’s real-world potential in action. With dynamic delivery and hands-on demos, he infused the discussion with energy, leaving a lasting impression that AI is not just a tool, but a creative collaborator.

In his closing remarks, Mr. CHU left the audience with a compelling thought: while prompt engineering evolves, the true advantage lies with creative minds who can harness technology—not just master it.

Dr. Clara KAN, Director of the MScEGM programme, also shared her thoughts on the programme’s journey over the past five years. She reflected on the significant transition from a joint degree to a double degree, discussing key milestones and the exciting future ahead. Her address provided valuable context, illuminating the programme's growth and its ambitious trajectory.

The evening transcended a simple reunion; it was a celebration of past successes, a forging of new connections, and a vibrant promise of future collaborations and achievements within the MScEGM family.
